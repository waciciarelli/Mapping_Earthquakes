# Mapping_Earthquakes

This analysis maps earthquake data from the past 7 days along with tectonic plates. This data is able to be further filtered to show the major earthquakes (those with a magnitude greater than 4.5). This is an important tool for being able to predict where and how frequently earthquakes can occur. Additionally it demonstrates how tectonic plates are often the epicenters for these events.

The end product was a map with an interactable legend in the top right that allows the user to change the map they are looking at:
